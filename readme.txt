Send notification emails of all new posts and new comments to everyone on a list. Great for private blogs.

== Description ==

It's hard to keep up with a private blog because there's no good way to subscribe to it. Subscription plugins aren't great because generally you have a finite number of people you want to get to it and asking each one to do a double-opt-in is annoying, and you still wouldn't have anything for comments.

This basically hooks into the new comment and new post actions to fire off an email to a list of people  for everything, so it's easy to follow the entire conversation even if it's comments on someone else's blog posts.

This initial version is a little rough, you have to edit the plugin to make the list. Future versions may fix this.

== Installation ==

1. Edit the array at the top of the plugin (in PHP) to include the emails you want.
2. Install the plugin.
3. Activate the plugin.
4. Enjoy.
